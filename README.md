## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- **This is for educational purposes only.**  
- Use at your own risk. Rec Room has a anti-cheat **you WILL get banned** if you abuse this.  
- Only test on alt accounts to advoid getting banned on main.  
- Game updates break things. Don‚Äôt cry just fix it you retarded skid.  
- **Offsets and function addresses need updating** after every patch.
- Also the offset names are Obfuscated so you will need to figure out what they are used for.

## üîß Updating Offsets

1. Dump the new Rec Room build.
2. Re-identify classes, methods, and offsets.
3. Replace broken RVA references in the source.
4. Recompile. Done.

If you don‚Äôt know how to reverse Unity/Il2Cpp this is not for you.
